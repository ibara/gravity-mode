gravity-mode
============
An Emacs Major mode for the
[Gravity](http://gravity-lang.org/)
programming language.

Very much a work-in-progress, but does basic syntax highlighting.

Drop `gravity-mode.el` into your lisp folder and add
```
(require 'gravity-mode)
```
to your `.emacs` to get started.

Automatically recognizes `.gr` and `.gravity` as Gravity code files.
